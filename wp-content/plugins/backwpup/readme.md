## Development

### Install dependencies & build

- `$ composer install`
- `$ npm install`
- `$ sudo npm install --global gulp-cli`
- `$ gulp buildAssets`

### Unit tests and code style

1. `$ composer install`
2. `$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit`

### Building a release package

If you want to build a release package
(that can be used for deploying a new version on wordpress.org or manual installation on a WP website via ZIP uploading),
follow these steps:

1. Run the commands from "Install dependencies & build"
2. The following command should get you a Free version ZIP file ready to be used on a WordPress site:

```
$ gulp free --packageVersion=?.?.? --compressPath=.
```
or for crate the PRO Version Zip for the german shop:

```
$ gulp pro --packageVersion=?.?.? --compressPath=. --language=de
```
or for crate the PRO Version Zip for the english shop:

```
$ gulp pro --packageVersion=?.?.? --compressPath=. --language=en
```

## Setup

You can install BackWPup locally using the dev environment of your preference, or you can use the DDEV setup provided in this repository which includes WP and all developments tools.

To set up the DDEV environment, follow these steps:

0. Install Docker and [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
1. Edit the configuration in the [`.ddev/config.yml`](.ddev/config.yaml) file if needed.
2. `$ ddev start`
3. `$ ddev orchestrate` to install WP.
4. Open https://backwpup-pro.ddev.site

Use `$ ddev orchestrate -f` for reinstalattion (will destroy all site data).
You may also need `$ ddev restart` to apply the config changes.

### Running tests and other tasks in the DDEV environment

For debugging, see [the DDEV docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/step-debugging/).
Enable xdebug via `$ ddev xdebug`, and press `Start Listening for PHP Debug Connections` in PHPStorm.
After creating the server in the PHPStorm dialog, you need to set the local project path for the server plugin path.
It should look [like this](https://i.imgur.com/ofsF1Mc.png).
